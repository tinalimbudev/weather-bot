# :sunny: WEATHER BOT :umbrella:

Ask this helpful Weather Bot to see if you should grab your sunnies or an 
umbrella before heading out.

It can tell you about the current weather, the weather for later today (up to 
12 hours later), and the weather for this upcoming week (up to 7 days).

## Dependencies

This app requires PyAudio and therefore uses Python 3.6.8 
(see https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/).

## Usage

Simply run the following command:
```python
python weather_bot.py
```
